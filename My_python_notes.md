Sure! Here's a clean **Markdown (.md) format note** for **Python Basics** that you can use directly:

# Python Basics

## 1️⃣ Python Syntax
- Python uses **indentation** instead of `{}` to define code blocks.
```python
if True:
    print("Hello, Python!")  # Indented block
````

## 2️⃣ Variables

* Variables store data.

```python
name = "Preksha"
age = 20
print(name, age)
```

## 3️⃣ Data Types

* Common data types:

  * `int` → integer numbers, e.g., `10`
  * `float` → decimal numbers, e.g., `3.14`
  * `str` → strings, e.g., `"Python"`
  * `bool` → True / False

```python
x = 10       # int
y = 3.14     # float
z = "Python" # str
flag = True  # bool
```

* Check type:

```python
print(type(x))  # <class 'int'>
```

## 4️⃣ Type Conversion

```python
x = 10
y = float(x)   # int to float
z = str(x)     # int to string
```

## 5️⃣ Input and Output

```python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))  # convert input to int
print("Hello", name, "your age is", age)
```

## 6️⃣ Operators

* **Arithmetic Operators:** `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `//`, `**`
* **Comparison Operators:** `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`
* **Logical Operators:** `and`, `or`, `not`

```python
a = 10
b = 3
print(a + b)   # 13
print(a ** b)  # 1000 (10^3)
print(a > b and b < 5)  # True
```

## 7️⃣ Comments

* Single-line comment:

```python
# This is a comment
```

* Multi-line comment:

```python
"""
This is 
a multi-line
comment
"""
```

## 8️⃣ Practice Questions

1. Print your name and age using `print()`.
2. Swap values of two variables without using a third variable.
3. Take two numbers as input and print their sum, difference, product, and quotient.
4. Take input of a number and check its type. Then convert it to float and print.
5. Use arithmetic operators to find remainder, floor division, and power of two numbers.
